//QUESTION 1: a function that logs all the names of each user to the console
const logAllNames = (usersArr) => {
  usersArr.forEach((userObj) => console.log(userObj.name)); //return not needed since forEach() doesn't return anything
};

// //logging q1 test to console
// logAllNames(users); //"Reuben"  "Laisha"  "Anne"  "Steph"  "Carmen"

//QUESTION 2: a function that logs strings that contain the name and username property for each user to the console
const getAllTags = (usersArr) => {
  usersArr.forEach((userObj) => console.log(`Hi my name is ${userObj.name}, and my tag is ${userObj.username}!`)); //logging a str for each user obj

    } else return longestBio; //returning the userObj if that users bio length was greater than the curr user
  }, usersArr[0]); //initializing accum to the first user obj in the given arr so that we have a valid obj with a bio property to compare to in the first iteration

//QUESTION 6: a function that returns an array sorted by follower count from least to greatest
const follower = (usersArr) => {
  return [...usersArr].sort((a, b) => a.followers - b.followers); //spread given arr to so as to not mutate the original arr and return a new copy arr- no nested properties so no need to worry about it being a shallow copy
